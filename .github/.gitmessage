# Git commit message template

# <type>[optional scope]: <description>
#
# [optional body]

# [optional footer(s)]

# Type can be one of:
# feat:     A new feature
# fix:      A bug fix
# docs:     Documentation only changes
# style:    Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
# refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
# perf:     A code change that improves performance
# test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
# build:    Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
# ci:       Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
# chore:    Other changes that don't modify src or test files
# revert:   Reverts a previous commit

# Examples:
# feat(auth): add OAuth2 authentication
# fix(ui): resolve button alignment issue
# docs: update installation instructions
# refactor: simplify validation logic

# Remember:
# - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
# - Do not end the subject line with a period
# - Separate subject from body with a blank line
# - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
# - Each line should be no longer than 72 characters
