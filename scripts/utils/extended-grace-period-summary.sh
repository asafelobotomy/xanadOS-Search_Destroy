echo "üìä IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Extended grace period: 30 minutes (1800 seconds)"
echo "   ‚úÖ Maximum grace period: 60 minutes (3600 seconds)" 
echo "   ‚úÖ Enhanced security monitoring and logging"
echo "   ‚úÖ Configurable security policies"
echo "   ‚úÖ Multi-layer validation maintained"
echo
echo "üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY FEATURES:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Command injection prevention (unchanged)"
echo "   ‚úÖ Path traversal blocking (unchanged)"
echo "   ‚úÖ Privilege escalation restrictions (unchanged)"
echo "   ‚úÖ Extended grace period monitoring (NEW)"
