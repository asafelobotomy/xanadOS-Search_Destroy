# Generate Tests

Generate tests for the selected code following project conventions.

1. Use the project test framework: `pytest`.
2. Mirror the source file path in the test directory.
3. Cover:
   - The main success path
   - At least one error/edge case
   - Boundary conditions if applicable
4. Follow the arrange/act/assert pattern.
5. Use descriptive test names: `"test_should_<expected behaviour>_when_<condition>"`.
6. Mock external dependencies but not the module under test.
7. Run `uv run pytest` after generating to verify tests pass.

Do not modify the source code — only create or update test files.
