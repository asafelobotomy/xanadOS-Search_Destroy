# Force Quit Notification Fix

## Issue Identified
When users force quit the application (via Ctrl+C, kill command, or system termination), the application would incorrectly display a notification stating "Application minimized to system tray. Click the tray icon to restore." even though the app was actually terminating, not minimizing.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `closeEvent()` method in `app/gui/main_window.py`:

### Original Problem Flow
1. **User force quits** application (Ctrl+C, kill command, task manager, etc.)
2. **Qt calls `closeEvent()`** as part of the application shutdown process
3. **Method checks minimize_to_tray setting** and finds it enabled
4. **Shows "minimized to tray" notification** even though app is terminating
5. **App actually closes** but user sees incorrect notification

### Why This Happened
The `closeEvent()` method couldn't distinguish between:
- **Normal window close** (user clicks X button) → should minimize to tray if enabled
- **Force termination** (external signals, force quit) → should NOT show minimize notification

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Force Quit Detection Flag
Added a flag to track when force termination is occurring:

```python
# Initialize force quit tracking
self._force_quitting = False
```

### 2. Enhanced Force Quit Method
Modified `force_quit_application()` to set the flag:

```python
def force_quit_application(self):
    """Force quit the application regardless of minimize to tray setting."""
    # Set flag to indicate we're force quitting (prevents minimize notification)
    self._force_quitting = True
    # ... rest of force quit logic
```

### 3. Signal Handler Setup
Added signal handlers to detect external termination:

```python
def _setup_signal_handlers(self):
    """Set up signal handlers for external termination detection."""
    def signal_handler(signum, frame):
        self._force_quitting = True
        # Attempt graceful shutdown
        try:
            from PyQt6.QtWidgets import QApplication
            QApplication.quit()
        except:
            pass
    
    # Handle SIGINT (Ctrl+C), SIGTERM (kill), SIGHUP (terminal close)
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler)
    if hasattr(signal, 'SIGHUP'):
        signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, signal_handler)
```

### 4. Updated Close Event Logic
Refactored `closeEvent()` to check force quit flag:

```python
def closeEvent(self, event):
    ui_settings = self.config.get("ui_settings", {})
    minimize_to_tray = ui_settings.get("minimize_to_tray", True)
    
    # If we're force quitting, don't minimize to tray or show notification
    if hasattr(self, '_force_quitting') and self._force_quitting:
        # Skip minimize to tray behavior during force quit
        self._cleanup_before_exit(event)
        return
    
    # Normal minimize to tray logic only for regular window close
    if (minimize_to_tray and hasattr(self, "tray_icon") and 
        self.tray_icon and self.tray_icon.isVisible()):
        self.hide()
        self.tray_icon.showMessage(
            "S&D - Search & Destroy",
            "Application minimized to system tray. Click the tray icon to restore.",
            QSystemTrayIcon.MessageIcon.Information,
            3000,
        )
        event.ignore()
        return

    # Regular close behavior
    self._cleanup_before_exit(event)
```

### 5. Extracted Common Cleanup Logic
Created `_cleanup_before_exit()` method to handle common shutdown tasks:

```python
def _cleanup_before_exit(self, event):
    """Common cleanup logic for application exit."""
    # Handle real-time protection shutdown
    # Stop monitoring
    # Save activity logs
    # Accept close event and quit application
```

## Files Modified

### app/gui/main_window.py
- **Added imports**: `import signal` for signal handling
- **Added initialization**: `_force_quitting = False` flag and signal handler setup
- **Enhanced `force_quit_application()`**: Sets force quit flag
- **Added `_setup_signal_handlers()`**: Detects external termination signals
- **Refactored `closeEvent()`**: Checks force quit flag before showing notification
- **Added `_cleanup_before_exit()`**: Common cleanup logic for both force quit and normal exit

## Behavior Changes

### Before Fix
| Termination Method | Notification Shown | Actual Result |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Normal close (X button) | "Minimized to tray" | Minimized to tray ✅ |
| Force quit (Ctrl+C) | "Minimized to tray" | App terminated ❌ |
| Kill command | "Minimized to tray" | App terminated ❌ |
| Task manager kill | "Minimized to tray" | App terminated ❌ |

### After Fix
| Termination Method | Notification Shown | Actual Result |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Normal close (X button) | "Minimized to tray" | Minimized to tray ✅ |
| Force quit (Ctrl+C) | No notification | App terminated ✅ |
| Kill command | No notification | App terminated ✅ |
| Task manager kill | No notification | App terminated ✅ |

## Technical Benefits

### 1. Accurate User Feedback
- Users no longer see misleading "minimized to tray" messages when app actually terminates
- Clear distinction between minimize and terminate actions

### 2. Improved User Experience
- No confusion about app state after force termination
- Consistent behavior across different termination methods

### 3. Better Signal Handling
- Graceful handling of external termination signals
- Proper cleanup during forced shutdown

### 4. Maintainable Code
- Clear separation of force quit vs normal close logic
- Reusable cleanup method for both exit paths

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Signal Handler Availability
- Graceful fallback if signal handling not available on platform
- Won't crash if signal setup fails

### 2. Missing Flag Attribute
- Safe check for `_force_quitting` attribute existence
- Defaults to normal behavior if flag missing

### 3. Early Termination
- Signal handler works even during app startup
- Force quit flag initialized early in constructor

### 4. Multiple Termination Methods
- Handles various termination signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP)
- Works with both internal force quit and external termination

## Testing Validation

### Startup Testing
- ✅ Application starts successfully with signal handlers
- ✅ Force quit flag properly initialized
- ✅ No impact on normal app functionality

### Force Termination Testing
- ✅ Ctrl+C (SIGINT) doesn't show minimize notification
- ✅ Kill command (SIGTERM) doesn't show minimize notification
- ✅ Timeout termination doesn't show minimize notification

### Normal Close Testing
- ✅ Window X button still shows minimize notification when minimize to tray enabled
- ✅ Normal close behavior unchanged when minimize to tray disabled

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- ✅ Works on Linux systems
- ✅ Graceful fallback for platforms without signal support
- ✅ No crashes on signal handler setup failure

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **More specific notifications**: Different messages for different termination reasons
- **Graceful shutdown progress**: Show progress during cleanup for large operations
- **Recovery mechanism**: Restore state after unexpected termination

### Integration Opportunities
- **Crash detection**: Detect abnormal termination vs normal force quit
- **Auto-restart**: Option to restart app after unexpected termination
- **Session management**: Save/restore app state across terminations
