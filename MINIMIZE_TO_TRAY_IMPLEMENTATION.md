## Minimize to Tray Feature Implementation Summary

### Problem
When the "Minimize to System Tray" setting was enabled, clicking the [X] button or selecting "File > Exit" would still fully close the application instead of minimizing to the system tray as expected.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Modified `closeEvent()` method
- Added check for `ui_settings.minimize_to_tray` setting
- If enabled and tray is available → hide window and show notification
- If disabled → proceed with normal close behavior including real-time protection checks

#### 2. Modified `quit_application()` method  
- Added same minimize to tray logic for File > Exit menu
- Ensures consistent behavior between [X] button and menu option

#### 3. Added `force_quit_application()` method
- Always exits regardless of minimize to tray setting
- Maintains real-time protection and scan checks

#### 4. Enhanced UI Options
- Added "Force Exit" to File menu with Ctrl+Shift+Q shortcut
- Added "Force Quit" to system tray context menu
- Added descriptive tooltips explaining the behavior

#### 5. Improved Settings UI
- Enhanced tooltip for "Minimize to System Tray" checkbox
- Explains that Force Exit bypasses the minimize behavior

### New Behavior

#### When "Minimize to System Tray" is ENABLED (default):
- ✅ [X] button → Minimizes to tray
- ✅ File > Exit → Minimizes to tray  
- ✅ File > Force Exit (Ctrl+Shift+Q) → Actually exits
- ✅ System tray "Quit" → Minimizes to tray
- ✅ System tray "Force Quit" → Actually exits

#### When "Minimize to System Tray" is DISABLED:
- ✅ [X] button → Actually exits (with protection checks)
- ✅ File > Exit → Actually exits (with protection checks)
- ✅ File > Force Exit → Actually exits
- ✅ System tray "Quit" → Actually exits  
- ✅ System tray "Force Quit" → Actually exits

### Code Changes Made

#### Modified Files:
- `/app/gui/main_window.py`

#### Key Methods Modified:
1. `closeEvent(self, event)` - Lines 6737-6778
2. `quit_application(self)` - Lines 6670-6736
3. `force_quit_application(self)` - Lines 6780-6822 (new method)
4. `setup_system_tray(self)` - Added Force Quit to tray menu
5. `create_menu_bar(self)` - Added Force Exit to File menu
6. `create_settings_tab(self)` - Enhanced tooltip for setting

### Testing
- ✅ Configuration setting properly saved and loaded
- ✅ Application runs without errors
- ✅ All exit methods work as expected
- ✅ Real-time protection checks preserved
- ✅ System tray notifications work correctly

### User Experience Improvements
- Clear distinction between Exit and Force Exit
- Helpful tooltips explaining behavior  
- Keyboard shortcut for power users
- Consistent behavior across all exit methods
- Preserves existing real-time protection logic
