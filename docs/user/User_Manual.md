## 🔍 Understanding Scan Types

S&D offers three types of scans, each designed for different needs:

### 🚀 Quick Scan (Recommended for Daily Use)
**What it does:** Scans your personal files and common threat locations  
**How long:** 2-10 minutes  
**Best for:** Daily security checks, new file verification  

**When to use:**
- After downloading files from the internet
- Daily security maintenance (set it as a scheduled task)
- Quick verification after installing new software

### 🔍 Full System Scan (Weekly Deep Clean)
**What it does:** Scans your entire computer, including system files  
**How long:** 30-90 minutes  
**Best for:** Comprehensive security auditing

## 🔬 Advanced Security: RKHunter Rootkit Detection

### What are Rootkits?

**Rootkits** are sophisticated threats that hide deep in your system, often invisible to regular antivirus software. They can:
- Steal passwords and personal information
- Control your computer remotely
- Hide other malware from detection
- Monitor your activities without your knowledge

### Running a RKHunter Scan

RKHunter is a specialized tool for detecting these hidden threats:

1. **Click "🔍 RKHunter Scan"** in the Scan tab
2. **Enter your password** when prompted (needed for system-level access)
3. **Watch the progress** - RKHunter performs 14 different security checks
4. **Review results** with easy-to-understand color coding:
   - 🟢 **Green** = Clean/Safe
   - 🟡 **Yellow** = Warning/Suspicious  
   - 🔴 **Red** = Threat detected

> 🔐 **Why Password Required?** RKHunter needs administrator access to check system-level security. This is normal and secure.

### Understanding RKHunter Results

**RKHunter checks for:**
- System file integrity (making sure important files haven't been tampered with)
- Known rootkit signatures (checking against databases of known threats)
- Suspicious system behavior (looking for signs of hidden malware)
- Network security issues (checking for unauthorized network activity)

## 🛡️ Real-time Protection - Your Security Shield

### What is Real-time Protection?

Real-time protection is like having a security guard for your computer that **never sleeps**. It continuously monitors your system and immediately responds to threats.

### How to Enable Protection

1. **Navigate to the 🛡️ Protection tab**
2. **Toggle "Enable Real-time Monitoring" to ON**
3. **Configure what to monitor** (recommended: keep default settings)
4. **Set automatic responses** (recommended: quarantine threats automatically)

### What Gets Monitored

When enabled, S&D watches:
- **New files** being created or downloaded
- **USB drives** and external storage when connected
- **System directories** for unauthorized changes
- **Network activity** for suspicious behavior

### Automatic Threat Response

When a threat is detected, S&D can automatically:
1. **🗃️ Quarantine** the threat (safest option - isolates but preserves for analysis)
2. **🚨 Alert you** with a notification
3. **📝 Log the event** for later review
4. **🔄 Update definitions** to catch similar threats

---

## 📊 Understanding Scan Results

### Reading Your Scan Report

After any scan, you'll see a summary with key information:

| Metric | What It Means | Good/Bad |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Files Scanned** | Total files checked | More = more thorough |
| **Threats Found** | Dangerous items detected | 0 = good, >0 = needs attention |
| **Scan Time** | How long the scan took | Varies by scan type |
| **System Health** | Overall security rating | Green = good, Red = needs work |

### When Threats Are Found

**Don't panic!** Finding threats is normal, especially on new systems or after browsing the internet. Here's what to do:

1. **🗃️ Quarantine First** (recommended for beginners)
   - Safely isolates the threat
   - Prevents damage while allowing investigation
   - Can be reversed if it's a false alarm

2. **🔍 Research the Threat**
   - Use threat name in online databases (VirusTotal.com)
   - Check if it's a known false positive
   - Look for removal instructions from security experts

3. **💭 Consider the Context**
   - Where was the file found?
   - Do you remember downloading/installing it?
   - Does it seem legitimate for your use?

### Managing False Positives

Sometimes legitimate files are mistakenly flagged as threats. **Signs of a false positive:**
- File is from a reputable software company
- You recently installed legitimate software
- Multiple users report the same false detection online
- The threat name includes words like "generic" or "heuristic"

**To handle false positives:**
1. Research the detection online
2. Add to exclusion list if confirmed safe
3. Report to ClamAV to improve future detection

## 🗃️ Quarantine Management Made Simple

### What is Quarantine?

Think of quarantine as a **secure jail** for suspicious files. Files in quarantine:
- ✅ Can't harm your system
- ✅ Can be restored if they're actually safe
- ✅ Can be studied for analysis
- ✅ Can be permanently deleted when you're sure

### Managing Quarantined Files

**To access quarantine:**
1. **Click the 🗃️ Quarantine tab**
2. **Review the list** of isolated files
3. **For each file, you can:**
   - **📋 View Details** - See why it was quarantined
   - **🔄 Restore** - Put it back if it's safe
   - **🗑️ Delete** - Remove permanently
   - **📤 Export Info** - Save details for research

### Quarantine Best Practices

**For Beginners:**
- ❌ Don't restore files unless you're 100% sure they're safe
- ✅ Do research threat names online before making decisions
- ✅ Do ask for help if you're unsure
- ✅ Do keep quarantined items for at least a week before deleting

**Safety Rule:** *When in doubt, leave it in quarantine!*

3. **Close other programs** - Free up system resources
4. **Enable rate limiting** - Prevent system overload

### "Too Many False Positives"

**Solutions:**
1. **Update virus definitions** - Newer definitions are more accurate
2. **Research detections online** - Check VirusTotal.com
3. **Add exclusions carefully** - Only for verified safe files
4. **Adjust sensitivity** - Lower heuristic detection if needed

### "Real-time Protection Disabled"

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. **Check system permissions** - S&D needs file access

4. **Restart S&D** - Close completely and reopen

### "Can't Run RKHunter Scan"

**Common Solutions:**
1. **Enter correct password** - Must be your user password
2. **Check sudo access** - Your user needs admin privileges
3. **Close other security tools** - Avoid conflicts during scanning
4. **Free up disk space** - RKHunter needs temporary storage
