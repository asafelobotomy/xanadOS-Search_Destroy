## Model Selection Strategy

### When to Use Advanced Models

1. **Claude Sonnet 4** - Choose for:

- Complex system architecture design
- Advanced reasoning requirements
- Comprehensive system analysis
- Sophisticated problem-solving

2. **GPT-5** - Choose for:

- Next-generation development projects
- Multimodal capabilities needed
- Enhanced reasoning requirements
- Complex project management

3. **Gemini Pro** - Choose for:

- Google ecosystem projects
- Multimodal development needs
- Advanced integration requirements
- Comprehensive analysis tasks

4. **OpenAI o1-preview** - Choose for:

- Mathematical problem-solving
- Deep reasoning requirements
- Complex algorithmic development
- Sophisticated analysis needs

### Fallback Strategy

If advanced models are not available:

1. Templates automatically fall back to GPT-4.1 or GPT-4
2. Core functionality remains intact
3. Specialized capabilities may be reduced
4. Performance remains reliable

## Implementation Details

### Frontmatter Configuration

Each template includes model targeting in its frontmatter:

### VS Code Integration

The framework includes enhanced VS Code settings for model selection:

- Direct model selection via command center
- Automatic template discovery
- Model-specific optimizations
- Enhanced chat integration

### Installation

Templates are installed with one-click VS Code integration:

1. Click the install badge for your desired template
2. VS Code automatically opens with the template ready
3. Model targeting is configured automatically
4. Start using advanced capabilities immediately

## Best Practices

### Model-Specific Optimization

1. **Match Task to Model**: Choose models based on specific strengths
2. **Leverage Specializations**: Use model-specific capabilities
3. **Consider Performance**: Balance capabilities with response time
4. **Plan Fallbacks**: Ensure compatibility with available models

### Development Workflow

1. **Start with General Models**: Use GPT-4.1 for initial development
2. **Upgrade for Complexity**: Switch to advanced models for complex tasks
3. **Specialize by Domain**: Use domain-specific models for expertise
4. **Combine Approaches**: Use multiple models for different project phases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model Not Available**: Falls back to compatible alternative
2. **Performance Differences**: Expected with different model capabilities
3. **Feature Compatibility**: Some features may vary by model
4. **Installation Issues**: Verify VS Code version compatibility

### Getting Help

- Review template documentation for model-specific guidance
- Check VS Code settings for model selection options
- Consult model-specific best practices
- Report issues via repository issue tracker

## Future Enhancements

The model targeting system is designed for extensibility:

- Additional models will be added as they become available
- Enhanced model-specific optimizations
- Improved automatic model selection
- Advanced routing based on task complexity
