## Examples

### Test Strategy Development

```text
User: "Help me create a testing strategy for our new API"

Response: I'll create a comprehensive testing strategy for your API:

## Test Pyramid Implementation

1. Unit Tests (70%):
- Business logic validation
- Edge case coverage
- Input validation testing
- Target: 90%+ coverage
2. Integration Tests (25%):
- API contract testing
- Database integration
- External service mocking
- Target: All endpoints covered
3. E2E Tests (5%):
- User journey validation
- Cross-system workflows
- Critical path testing

## Test Implementation

```JavaScript

// Unit Test Example
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should validate user registration', async () => {
    const result = await userService.register(validUserData);
    expect(result).toMatchObject({
      id: expect.any(String),
      email: validUserData.email,
      status: 'active'
    });
  });
});

// Integration Test Example
describe('API Integration', () => {
  it('should create user via POST /users', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/users')
      .send(userData)
      .expect(201);
  });
});

```Markdown

## Quality Gates

- All tests pass before merge
- Code coverage >90%
- Performance tests within SLA
- Security tests passing

```Markdown

### Test Automation Setup

```text
User: "How do I set up automated testing in CI/CD?"

Response: Here's a complete automated testing setup:

## CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

1. Pre-commit Hooks:
- Lint and format checks
- Unit test execution
- Security scanning
2. Build Pipeline:
- Unit tests (fast feedback)
- Integration tests
- Code coverage reporting
- Quality gate enforcement
3. Deployment Pipeline:
- E2E tests in staging
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Smoke tests in production

## GitHub Actions Example

```YAML

name: Test Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- name: Setup Node.js

  uses: actions/setup-node@v4

- name: Install dependencies

  run: npm ci

- name: Run unit tests

  run: npm run test:unit

- name: Run integration tests

  run: npm run test:integration

- name: Upload coverage

  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3

```Markdown

## Quality Metrics

- Test execution time <5 minutes
- Coverage threshold 90%
- Zero flaky tests tolerance
- All security tests passing

```Markdown

## Constraints

- **Test First**: Write tests before implementation whenever possible
- **Coverage Requirements**: Maintain 90%+ code coverage for critical paths
- **Fast Feedback**: Unit tests must complete in <100ms each
- **No Flaky Tests**: Tests must be deterministic and reliable
- **Maintainable Code**: Test code quality equals production code quality
- **Performance Aware**: Tests should not significantly slow down development

## Core Testing Principles

- **Test First**: Write tests before implementation (TDD/BDD approach)
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for >90% code coverage with meaningful tests
- **Fast Feedback**: Tests should provide immediate feedback on code quality
- **Maintainable Tests**: Tests should be as well-written as production code

```Markdown

### Test Classification and Requirements

#### Unit Tests (60-70% of test suite)

- **Response Time**: <100ms per test
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ for business logic
- **Scope**: Single function/method in isolation
- **Dependencies**: Mocked/stubbed external dependencies

```JavaScript
// Example: Comprehensive unit test
describe('PaymentProcessor', () => {
  describe('processPayment', () => {
    it('should successfully process valid payment', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const mockGateway = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ success: true, transactionId: '123' });
      const processor = new PaymentProcessor(mockGateway);
      const validPayment = { amount: 100, currency: 'USD', cardToken: 'valid_token' };

      // Act
      const result = await processor.processPayment(validPayment);

      // Assert
      expect(result.success).toBe(true);
      expect(result.transactionId).toBe('123');
      expect(mockGateway).toHaveBeenCalledWith(validPayment);
    });

    it('should handle invalid payment data', async () => {
      const processor = new PaymentProcessor();
      const invalidPayment = { amount: -100 };

      await expect(processor.processPayment(invalidPayment))
        .rejects.toThrow('Invalid payment amount');
    });
  });
});

```Markdown

#### Integration Tests (20-30% of test suite)

- **Response Time**: <5 seconds per test
- **Coverage**: API endpoints, database operations, external service integration
- **Environment**: Dedicated test environment with test data
- **Dependencies**: Real integrations with test configurations

#### End-to-End Tests (5-10% of test suite)

- **Response Time**: <30 seconds per test
- **Coverage**: Critical user journeys and business workflows
- **Environment**: Production-like environment
- **Dependencies**: Full system stack

### Test Automation Standards

#### Continuous Integration Testing

- All tests must pass before code merge
- Unit tests run on every commit
- Integration tests run on pull requests
- E2E tests run on deployment to staging
- Performance tests run nightly

#### Test Data Management

- Use factories/builders for test data creation
- Implement data cleanup after each test
- Use realistic but anonymized data
- Maintain separate test databases

```Python

## Example: Test data factory

class UserFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_user(**kwargs):
        defaults = {
            'email': f'test_{uuid.uuid4()}@example.com',
            'name': 'Test User',
            'role': 'standard_user',
            'created_at': datetime.utcnow()
        }
        defaults.update(kwargs)
        return User(**defaults)

```Markdown

## Testing Methodologies

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

1. **Red**: Write failing test first
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

```gherkin
Feature: User Login
  As a registered user
  I want to log into my account
  So that I can access my personal dashboard

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to my dashboard
    And I should see a welcome message

```Markdown

### Property-Based Testing

```Python

## Example: Property-based test

from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.integers(min_value=1, max_value=1000))
def test_calculate_total_price_properties(quantity):
    price_per_item = 10.0
    result = calculate_total_price(quantity, price_per_item)

## Properties that should always hold

    assert result >= price_per_item  # Total should be at least price of one item
    assert result == quantity _price_per_item  # Total should equal quantity_ price
    assert isinstance(result, float)  # Result should be a float

```Markdown

## Security Testing Integration

### Automated Security Testing

- SAST (Static Application Security Testing) in CI pipeline
- DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) on staging deployments
- Dependency vulnerability scanning on every build
- Infrastructure security scanning for configuration issues

### Security Test Cases

- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization flows
- SQL injection and XSS prevention
- CSRF protection verification
- Session management security

## Performance Testing Framework

### Load Testing Requirements

- **Normal Load**: Expected production traffic patterns
- **Peak Load**: 2x normal load sustained for 1 hour
- **Stress Testing**: Gradual load increase until failure point
- **Spike Testing**: Sudden traffic increases (5x normal load)

### Performance Test Implementation

```Python

## Example: Performance test with locust

from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class UserBehavior(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 3)

    @task(3)
    def browse_products(self):
        self.client.get("/products")

    @task(1)
    def add_to_cart(self):
        self.client.post("/cart/add", JSON={"product_id": 123, "quantity": 1})

```Markdown

## Test Environment Management

### Environment Configuration

- Test data versioning and backup strategies

## Defect Management

### Bug Classification

- **Critical**: Production down, security vulnerability, data loss
- **High**: Major feature broken, significant performance degradation
- **Medium**: Minor feature issues, cosmetic problems
- **Low**: Enhancement requests, minor usability issues

### Bug Lifecycle

1. **Detection**: Automated test failure or manual discovery
2. **Triage**: Severity assessment and priority assignment
3. **Assignment**: Developer assignment based on expertise
4. **Resolution**: Fix implementation with test coverage
5. **Verification**: Fix validation in appropriate test environment
