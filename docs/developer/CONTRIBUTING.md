# # Contributing to xanadOS-Search_Destroy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to xanadOS-Search_Destroy! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- PyQt6
- Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu/Debian recommended)
- Root/sudo access for security features

### Environment Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asafelobotomy/xanadOS-Search_Destroy.git
cd xanadOS-Search_Destroy
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the application:
```bash
python app/main.py
```

## Code Style and Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Keep line length under 88 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Organization

- **app/**: Main application code
- **app/core/**: Core functionality (scanning, security)
- **app/gui/**: User interface components
- **app/monitoring/**: Real-time monitoring features
- **app/utils/**: Utility functions and helpers
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests
- **dev/**: Development tools and scripts
- **docs/**: Documentation

### GUI Development

- Use PyQt6 for all GUI components
- Follow Material Design principles
- Ensure responsive design
- Test on multiple screen resolutions
- Maintain consistent theming

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_specific.py

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=app tests/
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Include integration tests for GUI components
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

## Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create a feature branch:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines

3. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Run existing tests
   - Add new tests for your changes
   - Test GUI functionality manually
   - Verify security features work correctly

4. **Update documentation**:
   - Update README.md if needed
   - Add docstrings to new functions
   - Update API documentation

5. **Commit with clear messages**:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new scanning feature

- Implement advanced threat detection
- Add GUI controls for new feature
- Include comprehensive tests"
```

6. **Submit pull request**:
   - Provide clear description of changes
   - Reference any related issues
   - Include screenshots for GUI changes
   - Request review from maintainers

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

Include the following information:
- Operating system and version
- Python version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Error messages or logs
- Screenshots if relevant

### Feature Requests

Include the following:
- Clear description of the feature
- Use case and benefits
- Possible implementation approach
- Examples or mockups if applicable

## Security Considerations

This project handles system security, so special care is needed:

- **Never hardcode credentials** or sensitive information
- **Validate all user inputs** to prevent injection attacks
- **Use proper authentication** for privileged operations
- **Follow principle of least privilege**
- **Test security features thoroughly**
- **Report security issues privately** to maintainers

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Principles

- **Separation of concerns**: Keep GUI, business logic, and data separate
- **Modularity**: Write reusable, testable components
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation and user-friendly error messages
- **Performance**: Optimize for responsiveness and resource usage
- **Accessibility**: Ensure UI is accessible to all users

### Git Workflow

- Use feature branches for all changes
- Keep commits atomic and well-described
- Rebase feature branches before merging
- Use conventional commit messages
- Tag releases with semantic versioning

### Documentation

- Update documentation for all user-facing changes
- Include code examples in documentation
- Keep API documentation current
- Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions

## Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: For questions and general discussion
- **Code Review**: Maintainers will review all pull requests

## Recognition

Contributors will be acknowledged in:
- CHANGELOG.md for significant contributions
- README.md contributors section
- Release notes for major features
