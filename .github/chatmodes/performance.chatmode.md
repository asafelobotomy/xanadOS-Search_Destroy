## Performance Optimization Strategies

### Database Optimization

```SQL

-- Example: Optimized query with proper indexing
-- Before: Full table scan
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 12345 AND order_date >= '2024-01-01';

-- After: Optimized with compound index
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON orders (customer_id, order_date);
SELECT order_id, total_amount, order_date
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 12345 AND order_date >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY order_date DESC
LIMIT 50;

```Markdown

#### Database Performance Standards

- **Query Optimization**: All queries under 100ms, complex reports under 5 seconds
- **Index Strategy**: Composite indexes for multi-column WHERE clauses
- **Connection Pooling**: Maximum 100 connections per app server
- **Query Caching**: 95%+ cache hit rate for read queries

### Caching Strategy Implementation

```Python

## Example: Multi-level caching strategy

class CacheManager:
    def **init**(self):
        self.l1_cache = {}  # In-memory cache
        self.l2_cache = redis.Redis()  # Distributed cache

    async def get(self, key):

## L1 Cache (fastest)

        if key in self.l1_cache:
            return self.l1_cache[key]

## L2 Cache (fast)

        value = await self.l2_cache.get(key)
        if value:
            self.l1_cache[key] = value  # Populate L1
            return value

## Cache miss - fetch from source

        return None

    async def set(self, key, value, ttl=3600):
        self.l1_cache[key] = value
        await self.l2_cache.setex(key, ttl, value)

```Markdown

- **Cache Invalidation**: Real-time updates with eventual consistency
- **Memory Efficiency**: Cache memory usage under 2GB per application server

### Frontend Performance Optimization

#### Code Splitting and Lazy Loading

```JavaScript
// Example: Route-based code splitting
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const Dashboard = lazy(() => import('./Dashboard'));
const Profile = lazy(() => import('./Profile'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
          <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
        </Routes>
      </Suspense>
    </Router>
  );
}

```Markdown

#### Asset Optimization

### API Performance Optimization

#### Request Optimization

```Python

## Example: Efficient data fetching with batching

class DataLoader:
    def **init**(self):
        self.batch_requests = defaultdict(list)

    async def load(self, resource_type, ids):

## Batch multiple requests

        if len(ids) > 1:
            return await self.batch_load(resource_type, ids)

## Single request optimization

        cache_key = f"{resource_type}:{ids[0]}"
        cached = await self.get_from_cache(cache_key)
        if cached:
            return cached

        result = await self.fetch_from_db(resource_type, ids)
        await self.cache_result(cache_key, result)
        return result

```Markdown

- **Pagination**: Limit results to 50 items per page with cursor-based pagination
- **Field Selection**: Support GraphQL-style field selection to reduce payload
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/minute per user, 1000/minute per API key

## Scalability Architecture

### Horizontal Scaling Patterns

```YAML

## Example: Auto-scaling configuration

kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: app-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: app-deployment
  minReplicas: 3
  maxReplicas: 50
  metrics:

- type: Resource

  resource:
  name: cpu
  target:
  type: Utilization
  averageUtilization: 70

- type: Resource

  resource:
  name: memory
  target:
  type: Utilization
  averageUtilization: 80

```Markdown

## Performance Testing Framework

### Load Testing Implementation

```Python

## Example: Comprehensive load testing

from locust import HttpUser, task, between
import random

class PerformanceUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 3)

    def on_start(self):

## Authenticate user

        response = self.client.post("/auth/login", JSON={
            "username": f"user_{random.randint(1, 1000)}",
            "password": "testpass"
        })
        self.token = response.JSON()["token"]
        self.client.headers.update({"Authorization": f"Bearer {self.token}"})

    @task(10)
    def browse_products(self):
        with self.client.get("/API/products", catch_response=True) as response:
            if response.elapsed.total_seconds() > 0.5:
                response.failure(f"Request took {response.elapsed.total_seconds()}s")

    @task(3)
    def search_products(self):
        query = random.choice(["laptop", "phone", "tablet", "headphones"])
        self.client.get(f"/API/products/search?q={query}")

    @task(1)
    def add_to_cart(self):
        product_id = random.randint(1, 1000)
        self.client.post("/API/cart/add", JSON={
            "product_id": product_id,
            "quantity": random.randint(1, 3)
        })

```Markdown

### Performance Test Types

- **Stress Testing**: Beyond normal capacity until failure point
- **Spike Testing**: Sudden traffic increases (5x normal load)
- **Volume Testing**: Large amounts of data processing
- **Endurance Testing**: Extended periods under normal load

## Resource Optimization

### Memory Management

```java
// Example: Efficient memory usage
public class MemoryEfficientProcessor {
    private static final int BATCH_SIZE = 1000;

    public void processLargeDataset(List<DataRecord> records) {
        // Process in batches to control memory usage
        for (int i = 0; i < records.size(); i += BATCH_SIZE) {
            int endIndex = Math.min(i + BATCH_SIZE, records.size());
            List<DataRecord> batch = records.subList(i, endIndex);

            processBatch(batch);

            // Hint garbage collection after each batch
            if (i % (BATCH_SIZE * 10) == 0) {
                System.gc();
            }
        }
    }

    private void processBatch(List<DataRecord> batch) {
        // Process batch with bounded memory usage
        batch.parallelStream()
            .map(this::transformRecord)
            .forEach(this::saveRecord);
    }
}

- Use microservices for independent scaling

### For Medium-Traffic Applications (1M-10M requests/day)

- Focus on database optimization and caching
- Implement horizontal scaling capabilities
- Use connection pooling and resource optimization
- Monitor and optimize critical user journeys

### For Low-Traffic Applications (<1M requests/day)
