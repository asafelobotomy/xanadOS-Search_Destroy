# Archived Legacy Test Implementation

This broad integration test was superseded by focused pytest suites.

## Modern Test Structure
- `tests/test_gui.py` - GUI component testing
- `tests/test_monitoring.py` - Monitoring system tests
- `tests/conftest.py` - Test configuration and fixtures
- `tests/demos/` - Interactive demonstration tests
- `tests/hardening/` - Security validation tests

## Historical Context
This file represented the original umbrella test approach that was replaced
by more focused, maintainable test suites during modernization.
