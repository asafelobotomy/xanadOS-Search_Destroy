## Current Theme System

The application now uses a single, unified theme manager located at:
- `app/gui/theme_manager.py` - Main theme management system
- `app/gui/themed_widgets.py` - Theme-aware widget utilities

## Key Improvements in Unified System

1. **Solid Colors Only**: All gradients removed for consistent solid color theming
2. **Optimized Performance**: Single theme manager reduces overhead
3. **Consistent Styling**: Update Definitions section matches header colors
4. **Better Maintenance**: Single source of truth for theming

## Theme Features

- ✅ Professional coral/strawberry color palette
- ✅ Solid color backgrounds (no gradients)
- ✅ Consistent header and UI element styling
- ✅ Enhanced button effects and interactions
- ✅ Proper contrast ratios for accessibility

These files are preserved for reference but should not be used in the current application.
