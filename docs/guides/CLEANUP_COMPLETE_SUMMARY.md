# 🎉 Modernization and Cleanup Complete

## Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive modernization and cleanup of the xanadOS Search &
Destroy repository for optimal solo developer workflow.

## 🧹 Cleanup Accomplished

### Files Archived

- **7 legacy setup scripts** → Single modern setup script
- **3 old configuration files** → Modern pyproject.toml + uv management
- **2 redundant documentation files** → Comprehensive guides in proper locations
- **1 deprecated tool** → Integrated modern functionality

### Archive Location

All deprecated files safely archived to:

```
