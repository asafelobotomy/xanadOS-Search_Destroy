```text

### Step 5: Copy Required Files

Create the app directory and copy files:

```bash

mkdir io.GitHub.asafelobotomy.SearchAndDestroy

## Copy the required files from your project

cp /path/to/your/project/packaging/flatpak/io.GitHub.asafelobotomy.SearchAndDestroy.yml .

```bash

## Get the actual commit hash from your repository

COMMIT_HASH=$(cd /path/to/your/project && Git rev-parse v2.5.0)

## Update the manifest

sed -i "s/commit: REPLACE_WITH_ACTUAL_COMMIT_HASH/commit: $COMMIT_HASH/" io.GitHub.asafelobotomy.SearchAndDestroy.yml

```text

### Step 7: Validate the Submission

```bash

## Lint the manifest

flatpak run --command=flatpak-builder-lint org.flatpak.Builder manifest io.GitHub.asafelobotomy.SearchAndDestroy.yml

## Test build in the Flathub environment

flatpak run --command=flathub-build org.flatpak.Builder io.GitHub.asafelobotomy.SearchAndDestroy.yml

```text

### Step 8: Submit Pull Request

3. **Feedback**: Address any feedback or requested changes
4. **Approval**: Once approved, your app will be built and published

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Build Failures

- **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all Python packages are included in `python3-requirements.JSON`
- **Network access**: Remember that builds have no network access
- **Permissions**: Use minimal required permissions in `finish-args`

### Metadata Issues

- **Invalid AppStream**: Validate your metainfo.XML file

- **License mismatch**: Ensure license in metainfo matches your repository

### Submission Rejection

- **Insufficient functionality**: Ensure your app provides significant value
- **Poor user experience**: Test thoroughly before submission
- **Security concerns**: Review and minimize permissions
