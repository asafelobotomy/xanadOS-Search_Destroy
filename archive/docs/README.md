## üóÑÔ∏è Archive Rationale

### Why These Documents Were Archived

1. **Completion Status**: All documented work has been successfully completed and integrated
2. **Historical Value**: These documents represent the project's development history but are not needed for current work
3. **Reduced Clutter**: Moving completed summaries keeps the active docs/ directory focused on current needs
4. **Preservation**: Important project history is preserved while maintaining clean active documentation

### What Remains Active

Current documentation in `/docs/` focuses on:
- **User guides** (installation, configuration, usage)
- **Developer documentation** (development setup, API reference, contributing)
- **Implementation guides** (current features, architecture, maintenance)
- **Project structure** (current organization, version control, architecture)
- **Release notes** (current and recent releases)
