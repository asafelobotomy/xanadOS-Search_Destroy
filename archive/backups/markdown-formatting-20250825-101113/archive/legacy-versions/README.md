## Retention Policy

### Automatic Retention

- **Major Versions**: Kept permanently for historical reference
- **Minor Versions**: Removed after 2 years unless compliance required
- **Patch Versions**: Removed after 6 months unless issues arise

### Compliance Considerations

- Regulatory requirements may extend retention periods
- Audit trails maintained for all version transitions
- Legal holds may prevent automatic cleanup

## Version Navigation

2. Review metadata files for version details
3. Use migration guides for upgrade paths
4. Reference changelog for version differences
