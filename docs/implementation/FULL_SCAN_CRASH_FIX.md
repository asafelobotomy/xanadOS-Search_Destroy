# Full Scan Crash Fix Summary
*Applied on: Fri  8 Aug 21:46:52 BST 2025*

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Threading and Timer Issues
- **Problem**: QTimer operations from wrong threads causing crashes
- **Fix**: Enhanced thread safety in ScanThread with proper cleanup
- **Files Modified**: `app/gui/scan_thread.py`, `app/gui/main_window.py`

### 2. Memory Management
- **Problem**: Memory pressure during large scans causing system instability
- **Fix**: Added memory monitoring, garbage collection, and limits
- **Files Modified**: `app/core/file_scanner.py`

### 3. Resource Limits
- **Problem**: Unlimited file scanning causing resource exhaustion
- **Fix**: Reduced default limits and added dynamic adjustment
- **Changes**: 
  - Quick scan: max 50 files, 2 workers
  - Full scan: max 1000-2000 files, 3-4 workers
  - Memory limit: 512MB

### 4. Timeout Protection
- **Problem**: Scans could run indefinitely
- **Fix**: Added configurable timeouts (5min quick, 30min full)
- **Files Modified**: `app/core/file_scanner.py`

### 5. Error Handling
- **Problem**: Unhandled exceptions causing crashes
- **Fix**: Comprehensive exception handling with graceful degradation
- **Files Modified**: `app/gui/scan_thread.py`

## Performance Improvements
- Reduced default thread counts to prevent overload
- Added memory pressure detection and garbage collection
- Implemented progressive file limits based on system resources
- Added scan cancellation support

## Safety Features Added
- Timeout protection prevents infinite scans
- Memory monitoring prevents system overload
- Thread-safe progress reporting
- Graceful error recovery

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test quick scan on Downloads folder
2. Test full scan on home directory with timeout
3. Test scan cancellation functionality
4. Monitor memory usage during scans
5. Verify no timer-related errors in logs

The full scan functionality should now be stable and safe to use without crashes.
