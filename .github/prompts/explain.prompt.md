# Explain Code

Explain the selected code. For each significant block:

1. State what it does in one sentence.
2. Identify any waste categories from §6 (W1–W16) present in the code.
3. Note any violations of §3 baselines (LOC thresholds, dependency budget).
4. Suggest one concrete improvement if applicable — do not refactor, only describe.

Reference the project instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for baselines and conventions.
