### Status
- **Archived**: These files served their purpose during development
- **Functionality**: All tested features have been integrated into the main application
- **Cleanup**: Moved to archive to declutter the root directory

## Current Status

- ✅ RKHunter integration with progress tracking
- ✅ Session management and error handling
- ✅ Cross-component authentication consistency

These test files can be referenced for future debugging or feature development if needed.
