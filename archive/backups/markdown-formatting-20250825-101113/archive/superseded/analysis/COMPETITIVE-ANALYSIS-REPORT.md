// template-validator.js
const requiredSections = [
  'Core Directives',
  'Requirements',
  'Implementation Standards',
  'Quality Criteria',
  'Security Considerations'
];

function validateInstructionFile(content) {
  // Validation logic for instruction completeness
  // Check for required sections, YAML frontmatter, etc.
}
```Markdown

**Benefits**:

- Consistent file structure
