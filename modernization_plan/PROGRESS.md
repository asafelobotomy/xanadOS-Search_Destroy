## Critical Path

1. **Implement Cryptography Library** (24h) - Replace manual crypto implementations with secure cryptography library
1. **Standardize Exception Handling** (12h) - Implement consistent exception handling across 83 components
1. **Implement Async File Operations** (16h) - Replace blocking file I/O with aiofiles in async components
1. **Implement Machine Learning Library** (32h) - Upgrade ML capabilities with scikit-learn

## Notes

- Update progress percentages as tasks are completed
- Mark status as: pending → in_progress → completed
- Record any issues or deviations from plan
- Update timeline estimates based on actual progress
