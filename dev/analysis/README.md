# Development Analysis Tools

This directory contains scripts and tools used for analyzing and maintaining the S&D codebase.

## Analysis Scripts

### `component_analysis.py`
Analyzes the project's component structure and dependencies.

**Usage:**
```bash
python component_analysis.py
```

**Purpose:**
- Identifies component relationships
- Maps dependencies between modules
- Generates structural analysis reports

### `fix_imports.py`
Automatically fixes import statements and dependency issues.

**Usage:**
```bash
python fix_imports.py
```

**Purpose:**
- Resolves circular import issues
- Updates import paths after refactoring
- Validates import dependencies

### `simple_component_validator.py`
Basic validation tool for component integrity checks.

**Usage:**
```bash
python simple_component_validator.py
```

**Purpose:**
- Validates component structure
- Checks for missing dependencies
- Reports component health status

### `integration_demo.py`
Demonstrates integration between different system components.

**Usage:**
```bash
python integration_demo.py
```

**Purpose:**
- Shows component interaction examples
- Tests integration points
- Validates system connectivity

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Run before major changes** - Use these tools to understand current state
2. **Validate after refactoring** - Ensure changes don't break dependencies
3. **Regular health checks** - Periodic component validation

## Output Location

Analysis results and reports are stored in `/dev/reports/` directory.
