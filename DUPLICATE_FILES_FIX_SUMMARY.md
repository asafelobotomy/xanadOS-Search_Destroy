# Duplicate Files Display Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The scan results were showing duplicate file entries like:
```
üìÅ Scanning Directory: ~/Documents
üìä Directories scanned: 1 | Remaining: 2
    ‚úÖ CHANGELOG.md
    ‚úÖ LICENSE
    ‚úÖ README.md
    ‚úÖ CHANGELOG.md      ‚Üê DUPLICATE
    ‚úÖ LICENSE           ‚Üê DUPLICATE
    ‚úÖ Makefile
    ‚úÖ README.md         ‚Üê DUPLICATE
    ‚úÖ RESTRUCTURING_SUMMARY.md
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in `app/gui/main_window.py` in the `handle_detailed_scan_progress()` method:

1. **File Tracking vs Display Logic Mismatch**: The code was tracking whether files had been added to directory lists to prevent duplicates in the tracking data structure, but the display logic was running independently.

2. **Display Logic Flaw**: The file display code was executing regardless of whether the file had already been displayed:
   ```python
   # This check only prevented adding to tracking list
   if current_file not in self._scan_directories_info[current_dir]["clean_files"]:
       self._scan_directories_info[current_dir]["clean_files"].append(current_file)
   
   # But this display always happened, causing duplicates
   if scan_result == "clean":
       self._append_with_autoscroll(f"    ‚úÖ {current_file}")
   ```

3. **Scanner vs Display Issue**: The file scanner itself was working correctly and only scanning each file once. The duplication was purely in the UI display logic.

## Solution Implemented
Fixed the display logic to track and prevent duplicate file displays:

### 1. Enhanced File Tracking Logic
```python
# Check if file has already been displayed (to prevent duplicates)
file_already_displayed = False
if scan_result == "clean":
    if current_file not in self._scan_directories_info[current_dir]["clean_files"]:
        self._scan_directories_info[current_dir]["clean_files"].append(current_file)
    else:
        file_already_displayed = True
elif scan_result == "infected":
    if current_file not in self._scan_directories_info[current_dir]["infected_files"]:
        self._scan_directories_info[current_dir]["infected_files"].append(current_file)
    else:
        file_already_displayed = True
```

### 2. Conditional File Display
```python
# Display file only if not already displayed (prevents duplicates)
if not file_already_displayed:
    if scan_result == "clean":
        self._append_with_autoscroll(f"    ‚úÖ {current_file}")
    elif scan_result == "infected":
        self.results_text.append(f"    üö® <span style='color: #F44336;'><b>INFECTED:</b></span> {current_file}")
```

## Files Modified
- **app/gui/main_window.py**: 
  - Enhanced `handle_detailed_scan_progress()` method
  - Added duplicate detection logic for file display
  - Modified file display to be conditional based on duplicate status

## Expected Results
After the fix:
1. Each file will only be displayed once in scan results
2. Directory headers will still show properly
3. Progress tracking remains accurate
4. No impact on actual scanning logic (files are still only scanned once)

## Validation
- ‚úÖ Application starts successfully without syntax errors
- ‚úÖ File tracking logic properly identifies duplicates
- ‚úÖ Display logic prevents duplicate file entries
- ‚úÖ Scanner functionality remains unchanged

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Clean, non-duplicated scan results
- **Performance**: Slightly improved (fewer UI updates)
- **Accuracy**: Display now matches actual scanning behavior
- **Reliability**: Consistent file display regardless of directory structure complexity
