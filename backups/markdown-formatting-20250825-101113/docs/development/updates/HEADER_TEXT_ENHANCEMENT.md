# 📏 Header Text Size Enhancement Complete

## 🔤 Much Bigger Header Text Applied

I've significantly increased the header text size across all three themes for better visibility and prominence!

### 📊 Size Improvements

#### **Before vs After:**

- **Previous Header Size**: 18px (small and hard to read)
- **New Header Size**:
- **Dark & Light Themes**: 28px (56% larger!)
- **High Contrast Theme**: 32px (78% larger for accessibility!)

### 🎨 Theme-Specific Updates

#### **🌙 Dark (Professional) Theme**

- Header text: `28px` (was 18px)
- Color: Pure white on strawberry gradient background
- **Result**: Bold, prominent header that stands out

#### **🌞 Light (Summer Breeze) Theme**

- Header text: `28px` (was 18px)
- Color: Rich dark text on summer gradient background
- **Result**: Clear, readable header with excellent contrast

#### **🔍 High Contrast (Accessibility) Theme**

- Header text: `32px` (was 18px) - Extra large for accessibility
- Color: Pure white on black background
- **Result**: Maximum readability for users with visual impairments

### ✨ What's Changed

1. **Main Application Header**: "S&D - Search & Destroy" is now much more prominent
2. **Theme Showcase Title**: Updated to demonstrate the new larger text
3. **All Theme Elements**: Headers throughout the interface are now more visible
4. **Accessibility**: High contrast theme gets even larger text (32px)

### 🚀 Testing the Changes

## Both applications are now running

- **Main Application** (`./run.sh`): See the bigger "S&D - Search & Destroy" header
- **Theme Showcase** (`Python theme_showcase.py`): Compare header sizes across themes

## To test

1. **Switch themes** using F12 in either application
2. **Compare** the much larger header text
3. **Notice** improved readability and visual hierarchy

### 📈 Impact Summary

- **Visibility**: Headers are now 56-78% larger and much more prominent
- **Readability**: Easier to read from a distance or for users with vision needs
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Better separation between header and content
- **Accessibility**: High contrast theme has extra-large headers (32px)
