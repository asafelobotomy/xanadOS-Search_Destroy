# Security Review Expert

You are conducting a comprehensive security review. Follow this systematic approach to identify
vulnerabilities and security gaps.

## Security Review Checklist

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] **Multi-factor Authentication**: Verify MFA is required for privileged accounts
- [ ] **Password Policies**: Check complexity requirements (12+ chars, complexity rules)
- [ ] **Session Management**: Validate secure session handling and timeout policies
- [ ] **OAuth Implementation**: Review OAuth 2.1/OIDC flows for security compliance
- [ ] **API Key Management**: Ensure proper key rotation and access controls
- [ ] **Role-Based Access**: Verify least privilege principle implementation

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

- [ ] **SQL Injection Prevention**: Check for parameterized queries
- [ ] **XSS Protection**: Verify output encoding and CSP headers
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**: Validate anti-CSRF tokens on state-changing operations
- [ ] **File Upload Security**: Check file type validation and malware scanning
- [ ] **Input Length Limits**: Verify maximum input size restrictions
- [ ] **Data Type Validation**: Ensure strict type checking on all inputs

### 3. Data Protection

- [ ] **Encryption at Rest**: Verify AES-256 or equivalent for stored data
- [ ] **Encryption in Transit**: Confirm TLS 1.3+ for all communications
- [ ] **Key Management**: Review key storage, rotation, and access controls
- [ ] **PII/PHI Handling**: Validate GDPR/HIPAA compliance measures
- [ ] **Data Minimization**: Confirm only necessary data is collected/stored
- [ ] **Secure Deletion**: Verify proper data purging procedures

### 4. Infrastructure Security

- [ ] **Network Segmentation**: Review firewall rules and network isolation
- [ ] **Server Hardening**: Check OS patches, service configurations
- [ ] **Container Security**: Validate image scanning and runtime security
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: Verify no hardcoded secrets in code/config
- [ ] **Monitoring & Logging**: Check security event logging and SIEM integration
- [ ] **Backup Security**: Validate backup encryption and access controls

### 5. API Security

- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Verify 100 req/min per user, 1000 req/min per IP
- [ ] **API Authentication**: Check token validation and refresh mechanisms
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Verify strict schema validation on all endpoints
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Ensure no sensitive data in error responses
- [ ] **CORS Configuration**: Review cross-origin request policies
- [ ] **API Versioning**: Check for secure version management

## Security Testing Requirements

### Automated Security Testing

````bash

## Example security testing commands

npm audit --audit-level high
safety check --JSON
bandit -r src/ -f JSON
semgrep --config=auto src/

```Markdown

### Manual Security Testing

- **Penetration Testing**: Annual third-party security assessment
- **Code Review**: Security-focused review of authentication/authorization code
- **Configuration Review**: Security settings validation across all environments
- **Social Engineering Assessment**: Phishing and social engineering resistance

## Vulnerability Assessment Framework

## Compliance Verification

### GDPR Compliance Check

- [ ] **Lawful Basis**: Valid legal basis for processing documented
- [ ] **Data Subject Rights**: Right to access, rectify, erase, portability
- [ ] **Consent Management**: Clear consent mechanisms and withdrawal
- [ ] **Breach Notification**: 72-hour notification procedures in place
- [ ] **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations in system architecture
- [ ] **DPO Involvement**: Data Protection Officer review completed

### HIPAA Compliance Check (if applicable)

- [ ] **Incident Response Plan**: Security incident handling procedures
- [ ] **Access Control Matrix**: User roles and permissions documentation
- [ ] **Encryption Standards**: Cryptographic implementation details
- [ ] **Security Testing Results**: Latest security assessment findings

### Security Monitoring Setup

- [ ] **SIEM Integration**: Security events forwarded to SIEM system
- [ ] **Alerting Configuration**: Real-time alerts for security events
- [ ] **Log Retention**: Security logs retained for compliance requirements
- [ ] **Threat Intelligence**: Integration with threat intelligence feeds
- [ ] **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning configured
- [ ] **Security Metrics**: Key security indicators tracked and reported
