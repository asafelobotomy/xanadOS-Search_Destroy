- Collects all advanced options from UI controls
- Passes options to ScanThread for processing
- Maintains compatibility with existing scan infrastructure

#### Combined Scan Coordination
- Integrates with RKHunter for comprehensive security scanning
- Shows enhanced scan information in results
- Coordinates options between different scan engines

**Enhanced Start Scan Flow**:
1. Determine effective scan type (Quick/Full/Custom)
2. Set appropriate scan path for Quick scans
3. Collect advanced options from UI
4. Display scan configuration in results
5. Check for RKHunter integration opportunities
6. Initialize enhanced ScanThread with options
7. Begin scan with full configuration

### 5. Updated ScanThread Support

**Description**: Enhanced ScanThread class to support new scan options.

**New Capabilities**:
- Accepts `scan_options` parameter in constructor
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- Provides foundation for future scan customization

**Scan Options Structure**:
```python
scan_options = {
    'depth': 1-3,           # Scan depth level
    'file_filter': str,     # File type filter
    'memory_limit': int,    # Memory limit in MB
    'exclusions': [str]     # List of exclusion patterns
}
```

### 6. Professional UI Styling

**Description**: Custom styling for all new UI elements to maintain consistent appearance.

**Styled Elements**:

#### Scan Type Combo (`#scanTypeCombo`)
- Green-themed border and focus states
- Larger padding and prominent font weight
- Enhanced hover and selection effects

#### Next Scan Label (`#nextScanLabel`)
- Light blue background with border
- Proper padding and rounded corners
- Distinct styling to highlight schedule information

#### Advanced Options Panel
- Collapsible group box with checkable header
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Professional form layout with clear labels
