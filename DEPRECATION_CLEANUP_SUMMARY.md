# Deprecation Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Performed comprehensive deprecated code cleanup to improve code maintainability and ensure all paths reference valid processes.

## Deprecated Code Removed

### 1. Obsolete Method: `show_detailed_tooltip`
**Location**: `app/gui/main_window.py` (line ~3061)
- **Removed**: Deprecated method that was no longer used
- **Removed**: Connection from tooltip timer to the deprecated method
- **Impact**: No functional impact - method was already a no-op placeholder

### 2. Legacy Security Settings Comments  
**Location**: `app/gui/main_window.py` (lines ~1804-1823)
- **Removed**: Large block of commented-out legacy security settings code
- **Reason**: Code was superseded by modular settings pages
- **Impact**: Cleaned up ~20 lines of dead code comments

### 3. Temporary Test File Organization
**Action**: Moved `test_firewall_enhancement.py` to `dev/test-scripts/`
- **From**: Root directory (improper location)
- **To**: `dev/test-scripts/` (proper test script location)
- **Reason**: Organizational cleanup and proper file categorization

## Files Verified as Current

### Core Modules
- All `app/core/*.py` files checked for deprecated imports and patterns
- No Python 2 legacy code found
- All imports are current and properly used
- `from __future__ import annotations` is modern Python (not deprecated)

### Configuration Files
- All config files in `config/` directory are current
- No outdated configuration references found

### Archive System
- Existing archive system is properly organized
- Legacy files are appropriately archived in `archive/` directories
- No cleanup needed in archived content

### Import Statements
- All PyQt6 imports verified as used (QMouseEvent, QWheelEvent confirmed in use)
- No unused imports detected in critical paths
- Type hints and modern Python patterns are current

## Testing Validation

### Application Functionality
✅ **Application starts successfully** after cleanup
✅ **All modules import correctly** 
✅ **No syntax errors** introduced
✅ **Real-time monitoring initializes** properly
✅ **GUI components function** as expected

### Code Quality
✅ **No linting errors** in main window file
✅ **Proper separation** of legacy vs current code
✅ **Clean file organization** maintained

## Cleanup Statistics

- **Lines of deprecated code removed**: ~25
- **Files cleaned**: 1 primary file (`main_window.py`)
- **Files reorganized**: 1 test file moved to proper location
- **Zero functional regressions**: All features working correctly

## Recommendations

### Current State
The codebase is now clean of deprecated code while maintaining full functionality. The existing archive system properly handles truly obsolete files.

### Future Maintenance
1. **Regular Reviews**: Quarterly check for new deprecated patterns
2. **Archive Policy**: Continue archiving rather than deleting working code
3. **Test Validation**: Always verify application functionality after cleanup
4. **Incremental Approach**: Small, targeted cleanups are safer than comprehensive overhauls

## Summary
Successfully removed deprecated code without breaking functionality. All paths now reference valid, current processes. The application maintains full compatibility while having a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.
