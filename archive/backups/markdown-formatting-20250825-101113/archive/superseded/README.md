# Superseded Content

This directory contains content fully replaced by newer implementations.

- Archive type: superseded
- Retention: 3 years from supersession
- See ARCHIVE_INDEX.md for inventory.

## Superseded Content Archive

## ðŸ”„ Replaced Content

This directory contains files that have been completely replaced by new implementations or approaches.

## Purpose

Superseded content is preserved for:

- Migration reference and guidance
- Historical context and decision tracking
- Compliance and audit requirements
- Rollback scenarios during critical issues

## Organization

## Supersession Classification

### Complete Replacement

- **Definition**: Entire file or system replaced by new implementation
- **Examples**: Framework migrations, technology stack changes, complete rewrites
- **Retention**: 3 years from supersession date

### Partial Replacement

- **Definition**: Significant portions replaced while maintaining some compatibility
- **Examples**: API updates, workflow modernization, standard upgrades
- **Retention**: 2 years from supersession date

### Evolutionary Replacement

- **Definition**: Gradual replacement through iterative improvements
- **Examples**: Progressive feature updates, performance optimizations
- **Retention**: 1 year from supersession date

## Supersession Metadata

Each superseded file includes:

```YAML

## Retention Policy

### Standard Retention

- **Complete Replacement**: 3 years from supersession
- **Partial Replacement**: 2 years from supersession
- **Evolutionary Replacement**: 1 year from supersession

### Extended Retention

- **Regulatory Compliance**: As required by applicable regulations
- **Critical Systems**: Extended for systems with high rollback risk
- **Complex Migrations**: Extended for migrations with ongoing support needs

## Migration Support

### Migration Guidance

- Comprehensive migration guides provided when available
- Breaking changes clearly documented and explained
- Step-by-step transition procedures included
- Testing and validation recommendations provided

### Rollback Procedures

- Rollback procedures documented for critical changes
- Rollback time estimates and complexity assessments
- Emergency contact information for rollback support
- Data preservation requirements during rollback

## Usage Guidelines

### Recommended Uses

- Migration planning and reference
- Understanding supersession rationale
- Rollback procedures during critical issues
- Historical analysis and lessons learned

### Migration Process

1. **Review Supersession Metadata**: Understand reason and complexity
2. **Study Migration Guide**: Follow step-by-step transition process
3. **Identify Breaking Changes**: Plan for compatibility issues
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate new implementation thoroughly
5. **Plan Rollback**: Prepare rollback procedures if needed

## Supersession History
