## 🔄 Next Steps Required

### **Manual GitHub Release Creation**
Since the automated GitHub Actions workflow failed due to a ClamAV checksum mismatch, you need to:

1. **Go to GitHub Releases**: https://github.com/asafelobotomy/xanadOS-Search_Destroy/releases/new
2. **Set Release Details**:
   - Tag: `v2.9.0`
   - Title: `xanadOS Search & Destroy v2.9.0 - Comprehensive Modern Test Suite`
   - Target: `master`
3. **Copy Description**: From `./RELEASE_NOTES_v2.9.0.md`
4. **Publish Release**: Set as latest release

### **Future Workflow Fix**
Consider updating the Flatpak manifest (`packaging/flatpak/org.xanados.SearchAndDestroy.yml`) to fix the ClamAV checksum for automated releases.
