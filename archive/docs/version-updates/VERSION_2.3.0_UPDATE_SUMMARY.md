## Major Features Implemented (v2.3.0)

### 1. Enhanced Delete All Reports Functionality
**Files Modified**: `app/gui/main_window.py`
- **Enhancement**: `delete_all_reports()` method now removes both ClamAV and RKHunter reports
- **Impact**: Unified report management across all scan types
- **User Benefit**: Single action clears all scan history

### 2. Advanced RKHunter Progress Tracking System  
**Files Modified**: `app/gui/main_window.py`, `app/gui/rkhunter_components.py`
- **Enhancement**: Real-time progress tracking based on actual scan output parsing
- **Features**:
  - Stage-based progress updates (14 distinct phases: 5% → 100%)
  - Authentication-aware tracking (stays at 0% during password dialogs)
  - Scan start detection with specific indicators
  - Sequential progress validation (only increases, never decreases)
- **User Benefit**: Accurate, professional progress feedback throughout scan lifecycle

### 3. Comprehensive RKHunter Output Formatting
**Files Modified**: `app/gui/main_window.py`
- **Enhancement**: Complete rewrite of `update_rkhunter_output()` method
- **Features**:
  - Color-coded results (green=clean, red=threats, orange=warnings)
  - Emoji-based status indicators with proper character encoding
  - Hierarchical output structure with section headers
  - Smart filtering to remove noise and display meaningful information
- **User Benefit**: Enhanced readability and professional scan result presentation

### 4. Scan Tab Layout Optimization
**Files Modified**: `app/gui/main_window.py`
- **Enhancement**: Improved column proportions for better visual balance
- **Impact**: Enhanced scan results display area and component integration
- **User Benefit**: Better visual organization and improved user experience

### 5. Enhanced Progress Tracking Architecture
**Files Modified**: `app/gui/main_window.py`, `app/gui/rkhunter_components.py`
- **Enhancement**: Single authoritative progress source with state management
- **Features**:
  - `_rkhunter_scan_actually_started` flag for proper state tracking
  - Priority-based stage processing (highest progress checked first)
  - Comprehensive stage validation with exact keyword matching
  - Eliminated conflicting progress sources between thread and main window
- **User Benefit**: Reliable, accurate progress indication without conflicts or regressions

## Critical Fixes Resolved

### 1. Progress Bar Regression Issues
- **Problem**: Progress jumping backwards (e.g., 40% → 35%) during scan execution
- **Solution**: Implemented specific keyword validation for each scan stage
- **Result**: Sequential progress that only increases throughout scan

### 2. Authentication-Phase Progress Updates
- **Problem**: Progress bar advanced during password dialog before scan started
- **Solution**: Added scan start detection and authentication-aware state management
- **Result**: Progress remains at 0% until actual scan begins after authentication

### 3. Stage Detection Conflicts
- **Problem**: Similar stage names causing incorrect progress triggers
- **Solution**: Enhanced stage matching with exact keyword validation
- **Result**: Precise stage detection without cross-contamination

### 4. Conflicting Progress Sources
- **Problem**: Thread simulation competing with real-time output parsing
- **Solution**: Removed thread-based progress simulation, using only output-based tracking
- **Result**: Single authoritative progress source with consistent updates

## Technical Improvements

### Code Architecture
- **Progress Tracking**: Centralized state management with clear ownership
- **Thread Coordination**: Enhanced communication between scan thread and main window
- **Error Handling**: Improved resilience during authentication and scan phases
- **State Management**: Proper initialization and cleanup for each scan operation

### User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Professional formatting with color coding and emoji indicators
- **Progress Accuracy**: Real-time updates that reflect actual scan state
- **Authentication Flow**: Clear indication of authentication requirements and status
- **Report Management**: Simplified unified interface for all report types

## Documentation Enhancements

### User-Facing Documentation
- **User Manual**: Added comprehensive RKHunter scanning section
- **Feature Descriptions**: Detailed explanation of new capabilities
- **Usage Instructions**: Step-by-step guides for enhanced features

### Developer Documentation
- **Release Notes**: Comprehensive changelog entries with technical details
- **Architecture Changes**: Documentation of progress tracking system improvements
- **API Updates**: Covered method enhancements and new functionality

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Considerations
- **Progress Tracking**: Verify accurate progression throughout scan lifecycle
- **Authentication Handling**: Test various authentication scenarios (pkexec, sudo)
- **Output Formatting**: Validate color coding and emoji display across different terminals
- **Report Management**: Confirm unified deletion functionality works correctly
- **Stage Detection**: Verify specific keyword matching prevents conflicts

### Performance Impact
- **Memory Usage**: Optimized progress tracking reduces redundant state updates
- **CPU Efficiency**: Eliminated competing progress calculation threads
- **UI Responsiveness**: Enhanced real-time output processing with smart filtering
- **Resource Management**: Better coordination between components reduces conflicts
