from typing import Dict, List, Optional
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class CacheNode:
    host: str
    port: int
    health_score: float
    last_heartbeat: float

class DistributedCache:
    def **init**(self, nodes: List[CacheNode]):
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.primary_node = self._select_primary()
        self.failover_strategy = ConsistentHashingFailover()

    async def get(self, key: str) -> Optional[str]:

## Advanced failover logic with health monitoring

        for attempt in range(3):
            try:
                return await self._get_from_node(key, self.primary_node)
            except NodeFailureException:
