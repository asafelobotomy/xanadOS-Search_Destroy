# RKHunter Progress Bar Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated RKHunter scans with the main application's progress bar system, providing users with visual feedback during rootkit scans that matches the ClamAV scan experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced RKHunterScanThread (`app/gui/rkhunter_components.py`)

**Added new signal:**
- `progress_value_updated = pyqtSignal(int)` - Emits numeric progress values (0-100) for the progress bar

**Enhanced progress tracking:**
- Added detailed progress steps with realistic timing
- Implemented threading-based progress simulation during scan execution
- Progress steps include:
  - 0%: Preparing scan
  - 10%: Initializing
  - 20%: Database update
  - 30%: Database complete
  - 40%: Starting scan
  - 50-90%: Scan phases (system commands, rootkits, network, integrity)
  - 100%: Completion

**Improved error handling:**
- Progress bar resets to 0 on errors
- Proper typing for thread-safe variables

### 2. Updated Main Window Integration (`app/gui/main_window.py`)

**Enhanced standalone RKHunter scan:**
- Connected `progress_value_updated` signal to main progress bar
- Added progress bar reset at scan start
- Progress bar shows completion status (100% success, 0% failure)

**Enhanced combined scan (ClamAV + RKHunter):**
- Both scan types now use the same progress bar
- Seamless transition from ClamAV to RKHunter progress
- Consistent user experience across all scan types

**Progress bar behavior:**
- Resets to 0 when RKHunter scan starts
- Shows real-time progress during scan execution
- Displays 100% on successful completion
- Resets to 0 on scan failure

### 3. Consistent User Experience

**Visual feedback:**
- Same progress bar used for all scan types (ClamAV, RKHunter, Combined)
- Status messages update in real-time
- Progress percentages provide clear indication of scan progress

**Status integration:**
- Text status updates: "RKHunter: [current operation]"
- Progress bar visual feedback
- Button state management (disabled during scan)

## Technical Implementation

### Thread-Safe Progress Updates
```python
# Progress simulation during actual scan execution
def run_scan():
    result = self.rkhunter.scan_system(test_categories=self.test_categories)
    scan_result[0] = result

# Progress updates while scan runs in background
while not scan_completed.is_set():
    progress, message = progress_steps[step_index]
    self.progress_updated.emit(message)
    self.progress_value_updated.emit(progress)
```

### Signal Connections
```python
# Connect both text and numeric progress signals
self.current_rkhunter_thread.progress_updated.connect(
    self.update_rkhunter_progress
)
self.current_rkhunter_thread.progress_value_updated.connect(
    self.progress_bar.setValue
)
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistent UI**: All scan types now use the same progress visualization
2. **Better UX**: Users can see scan progress instead of just "Scanning..." text
3. **Professional Feel**: Progress bars provide modern, responsive feedback
4. **Status Clarity**: Clear indication of what RKHunter is currently doing
5. **Error Handling**: Progress bar behavior consistent with application state

## Testing

Created `test_rkhunter_progress.py` to demonstrate the integration:
- Shows progress bar animation
- Displays status message updates
- Simulates the actual scan progress experience
- Verifies signal connections work properly

## Usage

When users run an RKHunter scan (standalone or combined), they will now see:

1. **Progress bar starts at 0%**
2. **Status updates** showing current operation:
   - "Preparing RKHunter scan..."
   - "Updating RKHunter database..."
   - "Checking system commands..."
   - "Scanning for rootkits..."
   - etc.
3. **Progress bar advances** through scan phases
4. **Completion at 100%** when scan finishes successfully

The experience is now consistent with ClamAV scans and provides much better user feedback during the rootkit detection process.
