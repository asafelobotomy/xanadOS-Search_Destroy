### 1. Adaptive Resource Management

```python
# Dynamic mode switching based on system load
modes = {
    'maximum_security': {     # <30% CPU, <50% RAM
        'scan_depth': 'deep',
        'ml_sensitivity': 0.9,
        'batch_size': 1
    },
    'balanced': {            # Normal usage
        'scan_depth': 'standard',
        'ml_sensitivity': 0.7,
        'batch_size': 5
    },
    'performance': {         # >80% CPU or >85% RAM
        'scan_depth': 'quick',
        'ml_sensitivity': 0.5,
        'batch_size': 20
    }
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Event Filtering

```python
# Smart filtering reduces processing by 80%
- High-risk files: .exe, .dll, .py, .sh -> Immediate processing
- Medium-risk files: .zip, .pdf, .doc -> Batched processing  
- Low-risk files: .txt, .jpg, .mp3 -> Background processing
- Excluded paths: /proc, /sys, /tmp -> No processing
```

### 3. Machine Learning Integration

```python
# Lightweight statistical anomaly detection
- File size anomalies (Z-score > 2.0)
- Access pattern anomalies (unusual process access)
- Behavioral anomalies (process behavior scoring)
- Real-time model updates
```

## Usage Integration

### Basic Integration

```python
from app.core.integrated_protection_manager import IntegratedProtectionManager

# Initialize protection system
protection_manager = IntegratedProtectionManager(['/home', '/opt', '/usr/local'])

# Add threat callback
def handle_threat(threat_info):
    print(f"Threat detected: {threat_info}")

protection_manager.add_threat_callback(handle_threat)

# Start protection
await protection_manager.initialize()
await protection_manager.start_protection()
```

### Advanced Configuration

```python
# Export current settings
config = protection_manager.export_configuration()

# Modify settings
config['performance_settings']['ml_sensitivity'] = 0.8

# Import modified settings
await protection_manager.import_configuration(config)
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Real-Time Metrics

The system provides comprehensive performance monitoring:

```python
status = protection_manager.get_status()
print(f"Files scanned: {status['performance_metrics']['files_scanned']}")
print(f"Threats detected: {status['performance_metrics']['threats_detected']}")
print(f"CPU usage: {status['system_health']['cpu_usage']}%")
