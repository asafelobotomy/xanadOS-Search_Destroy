# Deprecated Testing Scripts Archive

This directory contains test scripts that are no longer needed because:

## 1. **SELinux-Related Scripts**
- SELinux functionality was **removed** in favor of AppArmor-only approach
- These scripts test features that no longer exist in the application

## 2. **Dangerous Parameter Testing**
- `kernel.modules_disabled` parameter was **permanently removed** for user safety
- These scripts test functionality that was intentionally eliminated

## 3. **Fixed Security Issues**
- Security hardening fixes have been **confirmed working** and integrated
- These diagnostic scripts are no longer needed for troubleshooting

## 4. **Report Generation Scripts**
- These were **one-time reports** for documenting changes
