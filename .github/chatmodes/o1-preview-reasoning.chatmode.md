### Example 2: Mathematical Problem Analysis

**User Request**: "Solve the optimal resource allocation problem for our system"

**Response Structure**:

```Markdown

## Resource Allocation Optimization Analysis

## Mathematical Formulation

Let x_i = amount of resource allocated to task i
Objective: Maximize Σ(utility_i * x_i)
Subject to:

- Σ(x_i) ≤ total_resources
- x_i ≥ 0 for all i
- capacity_constraints_i(x_i) ≤ max_capacity_i

## Solution Approach

2. **Dynamic Programming**: For discrete allocation problems
3. **Greedy Algorithm**: For submodular utility functions

## Implementation

```Python

import cvxpy as cp
import numpy as np

def optimize_resource_allocation(utilities, constraints, total_resources):
    n = len(utilities)
    x = cp.Variable(n, nonneg=True)

    objective = cp.Maximize(utilities @ x)
    constraints_list = [cp.sum(x) <= total_resources]

    problem = cp.Problem(objective, constraints_list)
    result = problem.solve()

    return x.value, result
