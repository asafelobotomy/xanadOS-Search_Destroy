# Agent Workflow and Quality Instructions - MANDATORY

## Policy Classification

- **Enforcement Level**: MANDATORY for all GitHub Copilot agents
- **Scope**: ALL actions and tasks without exception
- **Compliance**: Required BEFORE any file creation, modification, or task execution
- **Philosophy**: **Quality over Speed - Thorough over Rushed**

## Executive Summary

All GitHub Copilot agents MUST follow a systematic **"Check First, Act Second"** workflow that prioritizes thoroughness, quality, and instruction compliance over speed.
This prevents the common issues of rushing through tasks, creating redundant content, violating organizational policies, and making avoidable mistakes.

## üö® **CRITICAL DIRECTIVE: Systematic Workflow Enforcement**

**NO ACTIONS** may be taken until ALL relevant instructions have been read, understood, and validated.
Agents must follow this mandatory workflow:

1. **üìö DISCOVERY PHASE** - Read ALL relevant instructions
2. **üîç ANALYSIS PHASE** - Understand requirements and constraints
3. **‚úÖ VALIDATION PHASE** - Verify planned actions against instructions
4. **üéØ EXECUTION PHASE** - Execute with full compliance
5. **üîÑ VERIFICATION PHASE** - Confirm successful completion

## üéØ **MANDATORY: Pre-Action Validation Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Comprehensive Instruction Discovery**

**BEFORE ANY ACTION**, agents MUST read and understand:

```bash

## Step 1: Check ALL instruction files that apply

find .GitHub/instructions/ -name "*.instructions.md" | sort

## Step 2: Read file organization policy FIRST

cat .GitHub/instructions/file-organization.instructions.md

## Step 3: Check toolshed for existing solutions

cat scripts/tools/README.md
find scripts/tools/ -name "*.sh"

## Step 4: Check documentation repository

cat docs/README.md
find docs/ -name "*.md"

## Step 5: Check archive for existing/deprecated content

cat archive/README.md
cat archive/ARCHIVE_INDEX.md

```text

### **Phase 2: Requirements Analysis and Planning**

**MANDATORY QUESTIONS** to answer before proceeding:

1.
**File Placement**: Where should this file/content be located according to file organization policy?

2. **Existing Solutions**: Does a tool, script, or documentation already exist in the repository?
3. **Instruction Compliance**: Which specific instructions apply to this task?
4. **Dependencies**: What other components or files does this affect?
5. **Quality Standards**: What validation and quality checks are required?

### **Phase 3: Action Validation Checklist**

**MANDATORY VALIDATION** before creating/modifying anything:

```bash

## File Placement Validation

echo "Planned file location: [PATH]"
echo "Checking against file organization policy..."
grep -A 20 "$(dirname [PATH])" .GitHub/instructions/file-organization.instructions.md

## Existing Content Check

echo "Checking for existing solutions..."
find . -name "_similar-name_" -o -name "_related-keyword_"

## Instruction Compliance Check

echo "Verifying instruction compliance..."

ls .GitHub/instructions/ | grep -E "($(echo [TASK_TYPE] | tr ' ' '|'))"

## Quality Standards Check

echo "Confirming quality requirements..."
cat .GitHub/instructions/quality-standards.instructions.md

```text

### **Phase 4: Execution with Documentation**

**MANDATORY EXECUTION STANDARDS**:

1. **Document Reasoning**: Explain WHY each action is being taken
2. **Reference Instructions**: Cite specific instruction files being followed
3. **Validate Continuously**: Check compliance at each step
4. **Update Indexes**: Maintain documentation and tool catalogs
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify functionality and compliance

### **Phase 5: Post-Action Verification**

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION** after completing any task:

```bash

## File Organization Compliance

echo "Verifying no root directory clutter..."

ls -la | grep -v "^[d-].*\(README\|CONTRIBUTING\|\.Git\|\.editor\|\.prettier\|\.Markdown\|package\)"

## Instruction Adherence

echo "Confirming all instructions were followed..."

## Review each instruction file that applied to the task

## Quality Standards Met

echo "Validating quality standards..."
./scripts/tools/validation/validate-structure.sh

## Documentation Updated

echo "Confirming documentation is current..."

## Verify indexes and catalogs are updated if needed

```text

## üìã **Common Workflow Violations and Solutions**

### **‚ùå VIOLATION: Root Directory Clutter**

**Problem**: Creating files like `DOCUMENTATION-REFERENCE.md` in root directory

**Solution**:

```bash

## ALWAYS check file organization policy FIRST

cat .GitHub/instructions/file-organization.instructions.md

## THEN place files in appropriate directories

## Documentation ‚Üí docs/

## References ‚Üí docs/guides/ or docs/references/

## Scripts ‚Üí scripts/tools/

```text

### **‚ùå VIOLATION: Recreating Existing Content**

**Problem**: Writing new scripts/docs when they already exist

**Solution**:

```bash

## ALWAYS check existing solutions FIRST

find scripts/tools/ -name "*.sh"
find docs/ -name "*.md"
grep -r "keyword" docs/ scripts/

## THEN extend existing content instead of recreating

```text

### **‚ùå VIOLATION: Ignoring Instruction Files**

**Problem**: Acting without reading relevant instruction files

**Solution**:

```bash

## ALWAYS discover and read ALL relevant instructions FIRST

find .GitHub/instructions/ -name "_$(task_type)_"

## READ each instruction file completely

## UNDERSTAND requirements and constraints

## THEN plan and execute with full compliance

```text

### **‚ùå VIOLATION: Rushed Execution**

**Problem**: Skipping validation steps to complete tasks quickly

**Solution**:

- **Mindset Shift**: Quality and thoroughness are MORE valuable than speed
- **Systematic Approach**: Follow the 5-phase workflow without shortcuts
- **Validation First**: Always validate before acting, not after fixing mistakes

## üõ°Ô∏è **Quality-First Mindset Enforcement**

### **Core Principles**

1. **Thoroughness Over Speed**: Taking time upfront prevents rework later
2. **Prevention Over Correction**: Follow instructions to avoid mistakes
3. **Systematic Over Reactive**: Use established workflows consistently
4. **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to do fewer things correctly than many things poorly

### **Success Metrics**

- ‚úÖ **Zero root directory violations** - All files in appropriate locations
- ‚úÖ **Zero redundant content** - Use existing solutions, extend when needed
- ‚úÖ **100% instruction compliance** - Follow ALL relevant policies
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive validation** - Complete workflow before execution
- ‚úÖ **Quality documentation** - Thorough, well-organized, and maintained

## üö® **Enforcement Mechanisms**

### **Mandatory Pre-Action Commands**

### EVERY agent MUST run these before ANY action

```bash

## 1. Instruction Discovery (MANDATORY)

echo "=== INSTRUCTION DISCOVERY ==="
find .GitHub/instructions/ -name "*.instructions.md" | sort

## 2. File Organization Check (MANDATORY)

echo "=== FILE ORGANIZATION POLICY ==="
head -50 .GitHub/instructions/file-organization.instructions.md

## 3. Existing Solutions Check (MANDATORY)

echo "=== EXISTING SOLUTIONS ==="
ls scripts/tools/
ls docs/guides/

## 4. Archive Check (MANDATORY)

echo "=== ARCHIVE AWARENESS ==="
head -20 archive/README.md

```text

### **Validation Before Creation**

```bash

## Before creating ANY file, validate

echo "Planned file: $FILE_PATH"
echo "Checking organization policy compliance..."

dirname "$FILE_PATH" | grep -E "(docs|scripts|.GitHub|archive|examples)"
echo "Result: $(test $? -eq 0 && echo "‚úÖ COMPLIANT" || echo "‚ùå VIOLATION")"

```text

### **Quality Gates**

- **Gate 1**: All relevant instructions read and understood
- **Gate 2**: File placement validated against organization policy
- **Gate 3**: Existing solutions checked and considered
- **Gate 4**: Action plan validated for compliance
- **Gate 5**: Execution documented with reasoning
- **Gate 6**: Results verified for quality and compliance

## üí° **Best Practices for Agent Excellence**

### **Discovery Phase Best Practices**

1. **Read Completely**: Don't skim instruction files, read them entirely
2. **Understand Context**: Know WHY each instruction exists
3. **Check Dependencies**: Understand how instructions relate to each other
4. **Plan Thoroughly**: Design complete approach before starting

### **Execution Phase Best Practices**

1. **Document Reasoning**: Explain decision-making process
2. **Reference Instructions**: Cite specific policies being followed
3. **Validate Continuously**: Check compliance at each step
4. **Maintain Quality**: Prioritize excellence over completion speed

### **Verification Phase Best Practices**

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all functionality works correctly
2. **Check Compliance**: Confirm all instructions were followed
3. **Update Documentation**: Maintain current indexes and catalogs
4. **Plan Maintenance**: Consider ongoing upkeep requirements
