# Quarantine Directory Permissions Fix

## Issue Identified
During application startup, users were seeing this warning:
```
Startup self-check warnings:
Weak permissions on quarantine (0o755); expected 0o700
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The quarantine directory was being created with default permissions (0o755) instead of secure permissions (0o700), which posed a potential security risk.

### Security Concern
- **0o755 permissions**: `drwxr-xr-x` - Owner, group, and others can read and execute
- **0o700 permissions**: `drwx------` - Only owner can read, write, and execute

The quarantine directory should be accessible only by the application owner since it may contain potentially malicious files that have been isolated.

## Technical Details

### Original Problem
In `/app/utils/config.py`, the quarantine directory was created without explicit permissions:

```python
# Create subdirectories
SCAN_REPORTS_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
QUARANTINE_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)  # Used default permissions (0o755)
LOG_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
```

### Security Check Logic
In `/app/gui/main_window.py`, the startup self-check validates directory permissions:

```python
if name in ("config", "quarantine") and mode not in (0o700, 0o750):
    issues.append(f"Weak permissions on {name} ({oct(mode)}); expected 0o700")
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Directory Creation (config.py)
```python
# Create subdirectories
SCAN_REPORTS_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)

# Create quarantine directory with secure permissions (0o700)
QUARANTINE_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
if os.name == "posix":  # Unix-like systems
    try:
        QUARANTINE_DIR.chmod(0o700)  # Only owner can read/write/execute
    except (OSError, PermissionError) as e:
        print(f"Warning: Could not set secure permissions on quarantine directory: {e}")

LOG_DIR.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
```

### 2. Enhanced Startup Self-Check (main_window.py)
```python
if name in ("config", "quarantine") and mode not in (0o700, 0o750):
    # Try to fix quarantine permissions automatically
    if name == "quarantine":
        try:
            d.chmod(0o700)
            print(f"✅ Fixed quarantine directory permissions: {oct(mode)} → 0o700")
            continue  # Skip adding to issues since we fixed it
        except (OSError, PermissionError) as e:
            issues.append(f"Weak permissions on {name} ({oct(mode)}); expected 0o700 - Failed to fix: {e}")
            continue
    issues.append(f"Weak permissions on {name} ({oct(mode)}); expected 0o700")
```

## Fix Benefits

### 1. Security Enhancement
- **Improved isolation**: Quarantine directory accessible only by application owner
- **Reduced attack surface**: Prevents unauthorized access to quarantined files
- **Compliance**: Follows security best practices for sensitive directories

### 2. User Experience
- **Silent fix**: Permissions corrected automatically during startup
- **No manual intervention**: Users don't need to manually fix permissions
- **Clear feedback**: When permissions are fixed, users see confirmation message

### 3. Robustness
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Only applies on POSIX systems (Unix/Linux/macOS)
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback if permission changes fail
- **Dual protection**: Both creation-time and runtime permission fixes

## Files Modified

### app/utils/config.py
- **Enhanced quarantine directory creation**: Added explicit chmod(0o700) after mkdir
- **Added OS detection**: Only applies secure permissions on POSIX systems
- **Added error handling**: Graceful handling of permission change failures

### app/gui/main_window.py  
- **Enhanced startup self-check**: Added automatic permission fix attempt
- **Improved feedback**: Clear success/failure messages for permission fixes
- **Fallback behavior**: Still warns if automatic fix fails

## Testing Results

### Before Fix
```bash
$ ls -la ~/.local/share/search-and-destroy/ | grep quarantine
drwxr-xr-x 1 vm vm  26 Aug  5 11:49 quarantine

# App startup showed:
# Startup self-check warnings:
# Weak permissions on quarantine (0o755); expected 0o700
```

### After Fix
```bash
$ ls -la ~/.local/share/search-and-destroy/ | grep quarantine  
drwx------ 1 vm vm  26 Aug  5 11:49 quarantine

# App startup shows no permission warnings
```

## Compatibility

### Platform Support
- ✅ **Linux**: Full support with chmod() functionality
- ✅ **macOS**: Full support with chmod() functionality  
- ✅ **Windows**: Graceful fallback (permissions concept differs)
- ✅ **Other POSIX**: Full support on Unix-like systems

### Backwards Compatibility
- ✅ **Existing installations**: Automatically fixes permissions on next startup
- ✅ **New installations**: Creates quarantine directory with secure permissions
- ✅ **Permission failures**: Graceful degradation with warning messages

## Security Validation

### Permission Verification
```bash
# Verify secure permissions
$ stat -c '%a %n' ~/.local/share/search-and-destroy/quarantine
700 /home/vm/.local/share/search-and-destroy/quarantine

# Verify access control
$ ls -la ~/.local/share/search-and-destroy/quarantine
drwx------ 1 vm vm 26 Aug  5 11:49 .
```

### Attack Vector Mitigation
- **Prevents unauthorized file access**: Other users cannot read quarantined files
- **Prevents information disclosure**: Directory listing not available to other users
- **Prevents tampering**: Other users cannot modify or delete quarantined files

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- **Encrypted quarantine**: Add file-level encryption for quarantined items
- **Audit logging**: Log all quarantine directory access attempts
- **Permission monitoring**: Detect and alert on unauthorized permission changes

### Maintenance
- **Regular checks**: Periodic verification of quarantine directory permissions
- **Update handling**: Ensure permissions preserved during application updates
- **Recovery procedures**: Automated recovery from permission corruption
